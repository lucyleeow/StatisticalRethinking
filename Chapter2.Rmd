Questions from 'Statistical Rethinking' by Richard McElreath, Chapter 2.

# Easy

1. 2&4 - $Pr(rain|Monday)$ & $Pr(rain,Monday) / Pr(Monday)$
2. 3 - The probability that it is Monday, given that it is raining. 
3. 1&4 - $Pr(Monday|rain)$ & $Pr(rain|Monday) Pr(Monday) / Pr(rain)$
4. We are inferring the % of water on the globe and relating this to the probability of a finger landing on water after tossing the globe. This probability has not objective reality as it either ends up on water or land, it cannot end up on 0.7 water.

## Question 1
Calculate posterior distributions:
a) WWW 
```{r}
#define grid
pGrid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20)
#sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 1

#define prior
prior <- rep(1,20)
#number 1 x 20 times

# compute likelihood 
likelihood <- dbinom(3, size = 3, prob = pGrid)

# likelihood x prior
unstdPosterior <- likelihood*prior

#standardise
post <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

plot(post)
```

b) WWWL
```{r}
#define grid
pGrid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20)
#sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 1

#define prior
prior <- rep(1,20)
#number 1 x 20 times

#compute likelihood 
likelihood <- dbinom(3, size = 4, prob = pGrid)

#likelihood x prior
unstdPosterior <- likelihood*prior

#standardise
post <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

plot(post)
```

c) LWWLWWW
```{r}
#define grid
pGrid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20)
#sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 1

#define prior
prior <- rep(1,20)
#number 1 x 20 times

#compute likelihood
likelihood <- dbinom(5, size = 7, prob = pGrid)

#likelihood x prior
unstdPosterior <- likelihood*prior

#standardise
post <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

plot(post)
```

## Question 2
Prior at <0.5 is 0 and >=0 is 1
a) WWW 
```{r}
#define grid
pGrid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20)
#sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 1

#define prior
prior <- ifelse(pGrid<0.5,0,1)
#number 1 x 20 times

# compute likelihood 
likelihood <- dbinom(3, size = 3, prob = pGrid)

# likelihood x prior
unstdPosterior <- likelihood*prior

#standardise
post <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

plot(post)
```

b) WWWL
```{r}
#define grid
pGrid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20)
#sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 1

#use above prior

#compute likelihood 
likelihood <- dbinom(3, size = 4, prob = pGrid)

#likelihood x prior
unstdPosterior <- likelihood*prior

#standardise
post <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

plot(post)
```

c) LWWLWWW
```{r}
#define grid
pGrid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20)
#sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers from 0 to 1

#use above prior

#compute likelihood
likelihood <- dbinom(5, size = 7, prob = pGrid)

#likelihood x prior
unstdPosterior <- likelihood*prior

#standardise
post <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

plot(post)
```

## Question 3
Prove $Pr(Earth|land)=0.23$

$Pr(Earth|land)=Pr(land|Earth)Pr(Earth)/Pr(land)$

$Pr(Earth|land)=(0.30*0.5)/0.65=0.23$

Note that: $Pr(land)=(0.5*0.3)+(0.5*1)$ or $Pr(Earth,land)+Pr(Mars,land)$ 

## Question 4

* Card 1: 2
* Card 2: 1
* Card 3: 0

$Pr(card1|data)=2/3$

## Question 5

* Card 1: 2
* Card 2: 1
* Card 3: 0
* Card 4: 2

$Pr(card1\cup card4 |data)=4/5$

## Question 6

* Card 1: black side-2, weight-1 = 2
* Card 2: black side-1, weight-2 = 2
* Card 3: black side-0, weight-3 = 0

$Pr(card1|data) = 2/4=0.5$

Using likelihood

## Question 7

* BB:2
  +BW:1 - 2
  +WW:2 - 4
* BW:1
  +WW:2 - 2
  +BB:0 - 0

$Pr(BB) = 4+2/8=0.75$

Using priors to calculate this:

```{r}
##ORDER:
# BB,BW,WW

#Data 1: card 1 is black side up
#Prior = all cards equally likely to be drawn. 
prior <- c(1,1,1)
#likelihood of each card, given data
likelihood <- c(2,1,0)

unstdPosterior <- prior * likelihood

posterior <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

#Data 2: card 2 is white side up
prior <- posterior

likelihood <- c(3,2,1)

unstdPosterior <- prior * likelihood

posterior <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

posterior
```

# Hard
## Question 1

```{r}
#Both species equally likely
prior <- c(0.5,0.5)
#Given data (twins), plausibility of species A and species B
likelihood <- c(0.1,0.2)

unstdPosterior <- prior * likelihood

posterior <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)

#Likelihood of next twins?

posterior[1]*0.1 + posterior[2]*0.2
```

Alternative way of computing:
Think of the species A prior as the plausibility of species A given the 1st bit of data, twins:
$$Pr(A|twins)=\frac{Pr(twins|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(twins)}$$

$$Pr(A|twins)=\frac{0.1*0.5}{0.15}=0.33$$

The species B prior is the plausibility of species B given the 1st bit of data, twins:
$$Pr(B|twins)=\frac{Pr(twins|B)Pr(B)}{Pr(twins)}$$

$$Pr(A|twins)=\frac{0.2*0.5}{0.15}=0.66$$

The likelihood that the next birth will also be twins, using the law of total probability, is:

$$Pr(A|twins)*Pr(twins|A)+Pr(B|twins)*Pr(twins|B) \\= 0.33*0.1+0.66*0.2=0.166$$

From [link](http://www.rpubs.com/andersgs/my_solutions_chapter2_statrethink)
The result of 0.167 makes sense. If the species was species B, then the probability of twins would be 0.2, if species A, it would be 0.1. As we donâ€™t know the species, it makes sense that the probability should be something in between those two values. Where exactly, will depend on how plausible species A and B are. Without any additional information, we see that that the probability of the twins is 0.15, or exactly in the middle. When observing a single twin birth, we should update the relative plausibility of each species accordingly. In doing so, the probability of observing twins in the next birth moves a little towards 0.2, reflecting that now species B is more plausible than species A.

## Question 2
$Pr(speciesA|twins) = Pr(twins|speciesA)Pr(speciesA)/Pr(twins)$

$Pr(speciesA|twins) = (0.1*0.5)/(0.5*0.1+0.5*0.2)=0.33$

## Question 3

```{r}
#prior = Pr(A|twins), Pr(B|twins)
prior <- c(0.33,0.66)
#Pr(A|single)
#(0.9*0.5)/((0.9+0.8)/2)
#Pr(B|single)
#(0.8*0.5)/((0.9+0.8)/2)
likelihood <- c(0.53,0.47)

unstdPosterior <- prior * likelihood

posterior <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)
posterior
```

You can also calculate:
$$Pr(speciesA|single) = Pr(single|speciesA)Pr(speciesA)/Pr(single)$$
Note however, that $Pr(speciesA)$ should be the updated one, given the 1st twins birth. We calculated this above:
$$Pr(speciesA|single) = (0.9*0.33)/(0.9*0.33)/(0.33*0.9+0.66*0.8) = 0.36$$

## Question 4
Prior = both species equally plausible.
Information about the test:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(ActualA=c(0.8,0.35), ActualB=c(0.2,0.65))
row.names(df) <- c("TestedA","TestedB")
kable(df)
```

Using only test result:
```{r}
prior <- c(0.5,0.5)
likelihood <- c(0.8,0.35)

unstdPosterior <- prior * likelihood

posterior <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)
posterior
```

Using the birthing data (twins then singleton):

```{r}
#use test data above as new prior
prior <- posterior

#calcualted above
likelihood <- c(0.3605442,0.6394558)

unstdPosterior <- prior * likelihood

posterior <- unstdPosterior/sum(unstdPosterior)
posterior
```
